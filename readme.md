# Install

1. Run `install.sh` to install everything
2. Set up python venv 
3. Run :PlugInstall in nvim to install plugins
4. If ncm2 errors arise install nvim with: `pip install nvim` instead of `brew install nvim` (I've always installed through brew first and then encountered the errors, and then resolved them by simply running the pip command.)
